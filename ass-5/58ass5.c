Assignment Details - The objective of this assignment is to avoid deadlock. For this purpose define two
					 global variables (Total_1 and Total_2) and initialize both of them to 10000000. You
					 should also have two mutexes to protect these two global variables. You need to
					 create three threads also (Th1, Th2 and Th3).
					 The function of thread Th1 is to generate a random quantity (not more than 10) and
					 subtract that quantity from Total_2 and add that quantity to the Total_1. Likewise,
					 The function of thread Th2 is to generate a random quantity (not more than 10) and
					 subtract that quantity from Total_1 and add that quantity to the Total_2. While
					 manipulating the Totals, the Th1 and Th2 should lock both the mutex and then
					 unlock it after changing the Totals.
					 The function of the thread Th3 is to keep displaying the individual Totals and Grand
					 Total (sum of Total_1 and Total_2). Make sure the displayed values are consistent.
					 Note that this program should run forever.
					 The order of locking and unlocking the Mutex is very important, because thatâ€™s what
					 avoids a Deadlock or creates one. Once you correctly identify the order for avoiding
					 Deadlock, you should upload the program. Also, include that information (as a
					 comment in your source file) regarding the order for creating Deadlock.
					 Make sure there are enough printf in your program so that it can be clearly
					 understood that there is no Deadlock.

Input Description  - No input
Output Description - Print the individual total and the grand total

Deadlock Sequence -

To avoid deadlock:
- Both threads should lock the mutexes in the same order.
- For example, both `threadOne` and `threadTwo` should lock `mutex_1` first and
then `mutex_2`.
- This prevents a circular wait condition, which is a key factor in deadlocks.
