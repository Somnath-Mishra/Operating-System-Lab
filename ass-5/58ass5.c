Assignment Details - The objective of this assignment is to create a deadlock.
For this purpose define two global variables (Total_1 and Total_2) and
initialize both of them to 1000. You should also have two mutexes to protect
these two global variables. You need to create two threads also.

The function of each of the threads is to generate a random quantity (not more
than 50) and subtract that quantity from one of the Total and add that quantity
to the other Total. While manipulating the Totals, each Thread should lock both
the mutex and then unlock it after changing the Totals.

The order of locking and unlocking the Mutex is very important, because thatâ€™s
what creates a Deadlock. Once you correctly identify this order, you should
upload the program. Also, include that information (as comment in your source
file) how to avoid this kind of Deadlock.

If these two Threads, Two Totals and Two Mutex are not good enough for Deadlock;
Then you need to create one more Thread, one more Total and and one more Mutex;
and carry on the same experiment.

Make sure there are enough printf in your program so that it can be clearly
understood that there is a Deadlock. One way to ensure enough printf is to
display the total of Total_1 and Total_2 all the time after every operation on
it.

Input Description  - No input
Output Description - Print the individual total and the grand total

Deadlock Sequence -

To avoid deadlock:
- Both threads should lock the mutexes in the same order.
- For example, both `threadOne` and `threadTwo` should lock `mutex_1` first and
then `mutex_2`.
- This prevents a circular wait condition, which is a key factor in deadlocks.
